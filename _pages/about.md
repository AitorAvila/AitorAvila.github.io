Aitor Àvila graduated in __Geography and Spatial Planning__ in 2017 from the [Universitat Rovira i Virgili](https://www.urv.cat/en/). During the degree he showed a special interest in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and decided to specialize in this field through a master's degree in GIS and Remote Sensing offered by the Universitat Autónoma de Barcelona (2017-2018). At present, he is studying in the [Doctoral Program of City, Territory and Sustainable Planning (URV)](http://www.doctor.urv.cat/en/prospective-students/courses/7724/index/) and at the same time enjoys the "[aid for pre-doc contracts for the training of doctors](http://www.aei.gob.es/portal/site/MICINN/menuitem.dbc68b34d11ccbd5d52ffeb801432ea0/?vgnextoid=131955e2d5e01610VgnVCM1000001d04140aRCRD&lang_choosen=en)" of Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (ref. PRE2018-084802), that allow him to establish a contractual relationship as a predoctoral researcher with the URV (from 2019 to 2023). 

The thesis is related to the research line that addresses the __territorial studies, landscape and Cultural Ecosystem Services (CES) through Volunteered Geographic Information (VGI) and with GIS as the main tool__. He is also part of the [Territorial Analysis and Tourism Studies Research Group (GRATET)](http://www.gratet.urv.cat/ca/) and he has participated as a member of the work team in the research project called "[El paisaje como valor colectivo. Análisis de su significado, usos y percepción social: CHORA](https://choramineco.wixsite.com/chora)" (ref. CSO2017-82411-P) of the Department of Geography of the URV. Currently he participates as a member in another project financed by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation called "Servicios ecosistémicos culturales, salud y bienestar en zonas urbanas y periurbanas con clústeres petroquímicos: RESTAURA" (ref.
